## 5. How to Edit This Portfolio (Make It Your's)

*Note :-This is a beginner's guide for those who have never worked on a Next.js project before. If you can understand the project, it's in your hands to make changes and create a portfolio that's 10 times better. You can use its clone for a quick start.*

### 1. Your Name and Photo

In the `root` directory, you'll find a `sections` folder. Inside this folder, locate the `Intro.jsx` file.

Within the `intro` file, update the following details:
- Shivraj - Your Name
- Web Developer - Profession
- /images/cartoon0.png - Your Photo

Remember to have your photo uploaded in the `images` folder located within the `public` directory.

### 2. Skills

In the `root` directory, you'll find a `constants` folder. Inside this folder, locate the `SkillsData.jsx`

- Add or remove skills according to your preferences.
- Use Desire icon from `react-icons` library.
- Give desire color to icon.

### 3. Projects

Just like with Skills, we have a `ProjectsData.js` file located in the `constants` folder.

All you need to do is replace the existing data with your own (name: Your project name, url: Project Live URL, imageUrl: Image URL from the `images` folder in the public `directory`).

### 4. My Journey

Similar to Skills and Projects, you only need to customize the data in the `JourneyData.jsx` file according to yourself.

### 5. Apps 

You don't need to change the app data, but if you want, you can create similar easy apps and replace the data in the `AppsData.jsx` file.

Suggetion for apps :- To-do List App, Weather App, Random Quote Generator, Random Jokes Generator, Basic Calculator, Countdown Timer, Recipe Finder etc.

> Note :- If you're not able to customize the portfolio or run the project in your local environment, **don't worry**. It's not a journey of just 1 or 2 days, it takes time. For me, I was able to create it after 1 year of consistent learning. If you're not able to use its clone, just leave it and keep learning. You'll create a better portfolio or project one day.
