        <p>Mode : Remote (Work From Home)</p> I obtained my first internship
        after learning coding from YouTube in 5 months. Essentially, it is a
        startup-based company where all team members, including myself, are
        working on an online salon appointment booking application. This is my
        first experience with a real-world project, and I have learned a lot
        from it. Primarily, I learned frontend design and the functionality of
        dynamic applications, Redux, reactstrap, as well as how a team
        collaborates on a single project, including code merging using Git and
        GitHub.

        After completing my first internship, I wanted to pursue an offline
        intern job. So, I went for more than 5 interviews in two months. It was
        a little challenging to get shortlisted for interviews because I focused
        on learning web development and the mathematics involved. As a result, I
        didn&apos;t create many projects to showcase and was not aware of GitHub.
        Subsequently, I joined a remote non-paid internship that would pay me
        after two months. However, due to a lack of response and slow progress,
        my trust was broken, and I quit the internship. Nevertheless, I worked
        on three full-stack projects during that time, which boosted my
        confidence to undertake and complete any project using the MERN stack.
